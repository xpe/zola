## Background

While searching for themes, I came across [Zola Tale](https://github.com/aaranxu/tale-zola). Sadly, the project's last update was on Dec 4, 2021. Shortly after, I decided to fork the project and add my own touches to it.

The name Mabuya comes from the [Mabuya hispaniolae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mabuya_hispaniolae?useskin=vector), a possibly extinct[^1] species of skink endemic to the Dominican Republic, my home country.

## Features and Improvements

While working on the theme, I have added new functionality and made many quality of life improvements. Here's a short list:

- Refactored stylesheets.
- Added Dark theme and color theme toggle.
- Added new footer navigation.
- Created a custom GitHub Action to deploy Zola sites faster than any other GitHub Actions using Docker.
- Refined page transitions from desktop to mobile and viceversa.
- Centralized custom variablesâ€“made it easier to customize the site's colors.
- Addressed PR [#7](https://github.com/aaranxu/tale-zola/pull/7) fixing the pagination problem present in the original Zola theme.
- Addressed Issue [#4](https://github.com/aaranxu/tale-zola/issues/4) fixing custom text not being used correctly.
- Addressed (temporarily) Issue [#1](https://github.com/aaranxu/tale-zola/issues/1) by removing the erroneous pinned marker.
- Optimized for speed and accessibility. Subtle color changes to make the text more readable, etc.
- Many other small improvements...

## Running the Site Locally

Tips that will help you develop and preview the site locally.

### Requirements

Before using the theme, you need to install [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/installation/) â‰¥ 0.18.0.

### Quick Start

```bash
# clone the repo
git clone git@github.com:semanticdata/mabuya.git
# change directory into the cloned folder
cd mabuya
# serve the site locally
zola serve
# open http://127.0.0.1:1111/ in the browser
```

For more detailed instructions, visit the [Documentation](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/themes/installing-and-using-themes/) page about installing and using themes.

### Useful Commands

A short list of commands that will help you develop your own version of the theme.

| Command                    | Description                |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `zola init <repo-name>`    | Initiate new Zola site     |
| `zola build`               | Build only                 |
| `zola serve`               | Build and Serve            |

## Customization

You can changed the configuration, templates and content yourself. Refer to the `config.toml`, and templates files for ideas. In most cases you only need to modify the contents of `config.toml` to customize the appearance of your blog. Make sure to visit tyhe [Zola Documentation](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/overview/).

### Custom CSS Styles

Adding custom CSS is as easy as adding your styles to `sass/_custom.scss`. This is made possible because SCSS files are backwards compatible with CSS. This means you can type normal CSS code into a SCSS file and it will be valid.
